# CS602 - Applied Algorithms: Reading Project

This repository contains my reading project based on the material from the **CS602 - Applied Algorithms** course. The project explores various advanced algorithmic techniques, including approximation algorithms, parameterized algorithms, and advanced data structures.


## Course Content

### 1. Approximation Algorithms
   - **Topics**: 
     - Geometric independent set
     - Set cover, hitting set
     - Traveling salesman problem
     - Clustering (k-center/k-median)
     - Steiner tree, embedding, etc.

### 2. Parameterized Algorithms
   - **Topics**: 
     - Basic kernelization
     - Color coding
     - Parameterized approximation (FPT-approximation, lossy kernelization)
     - Bidimensionality, etc.

### 3. Advanced Data Structures
   - **Topics**:
     - Geometry: Orthogonal range search, point location, approximate nearest neighbors/LSH.
     - Graphs: Dynamic connectivity, dynamic reachability, approximate distance oracles.
     - Other models: Succinct data structures, external memory, streaming/sketching.
